# libsignal [WIP]
right so i've forked this openbazaar libsignal fork mostly to replace all AES crypto primitives with ChaCha20
identity keys to be switched to ed25519
mac's to poly1305

yay.

bellow is the 'original' OpenBazaar readme

----
This go library is an implementation of the signal asynchronous messaging [protocol](https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/) modified for use in OpenBazaar.

Modifications include:
  - Removed all communication with the signal servers. This library only handles session state management, encryption, and decryption. It's up to you to implement a transport for the ciphertext. 
  - Removed prekey transport. Again, you need to implement a method of getting Alice's prekey bundle to Bob so that Bob can send the first message.
  - Removed message metadata. Messages are not tagged with the recipient ID. This allows them to be stored on untrusted servers without leaking metadata. The cost, however, is that to decrypt a message one must iterative over all open sessions to decrypt the message. Assuming the number of sessions a user keeps open at any given time is relatively small, this shouldn't have scaling issues. It may be possible to improve the efficiency here by tagging each message with a shared secret that ratchets forward, but at the cost of more complexity. 
  - [TODO] Identity keys switched to RSA (which is what OpenBazaar/IPFS uses).
